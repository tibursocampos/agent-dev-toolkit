## Purpose

**agent-dev-toolkit** ships one portable core (skills, policy, router, SDD contracts) plus per-agent adapters that publish that core into host install roots. `scripts/toolkit.ps1` syncs, validates, and uninstalls. The default write destination is an in-repo fixture. Live profile writes require `-AllowUserHome`.

## Actors / users

- Operators who sync a supported agent and invoke skills by id.
- Maintainers who run core validation and fixture smokes.

## Boundaries

- In scope: `core/` (skills, policy, router, SDD contracts), `adapters/` (registry publish surfaces), CLI under `scripts/` (`toolkit.ps1`, `sync-agent.ps1`, `validate-agent.ps1`), in-repo install fixtures, and CI on pull requests to `develop` (`validate`, adapter smokes, `docs-strict`, gate `ci-ok`). The default `validate` job runs named asserts and an `-AllowUserHome` probe under a disposable profile. It does not run `validate-core` or sync a real user home.
- Out of scope: Spec Kit, uv, and specify as a runtime dependency; SQLite/FTS as a deliverable.
